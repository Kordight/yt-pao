        <p>This report was generated automatically using the playlist backup feature. It includes metadata from all
            available videos, as well as entries for videos that are no longer accessible on YouTube.</p>
        <p>For unavailable videos, partial metadata (such as titles or video IDs) may still be present. You can attempt
            to recover additional information using one of the following methods:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Search the video URL or ID in your previous YTPO exports (CSV, HTML, SQL).</li>
            <li>Use the generated link next to the unavailable video to check the Internet Archive for a cached version.
            </li>
            <li>Perform a manual search using the video URL on third-party websites or forums to identify potential
                context.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I'm continually working to improve this tool and expand its features. Contributions and feedback are always
            welcome!</p>
