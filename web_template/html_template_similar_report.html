        <p>This report was generated automatically based on the playlists you marked for export. It includes detailed
            information about each playlist and all the videos found within them.</p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> This tool does not download video content. It only analyzes metadata such as titles, durations,
            and playlist structure. Make sure your playlists are public or unlisted so they can be accessed properly.
        </p>
        <p>I'm continually working to improve this tool and expand its features. Contributions and feedback are always
            welcome!</p>
